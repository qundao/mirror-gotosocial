        <h2>Authorize Remote Interaction</h2>
        <p>It looks like you're trying to interact with a post or account from a different instance.</p>
        <p>Because GoToSocial does not come with a web client built in, this is not supported.</p>
        <p>Instead, you can interact with the post or account by copying the URL shown below, and pasting it into the search bar of whatever app you normally use for your GoToSocial account:</p>
        <div class="prism-highlighted"><pre><code class="language-uri">{{- .interactionURI -}}</code></pre></div>
